## Implementation of "Perceptual Representations of Optical Illusions in Deep Vision Networks" â€“ Mark Penrod

Final project for Neuro240 Biological and Artificial Intelligence

*Abstract*:
Despite astounding advances in the use of neural networks for computer vision, there is still debate on
the internal learning mechanisms that drive these powerful models and in particular how similar these
processes are to biological vision. In order to investigate this, this work considers optical illusions,
a class a visual stimuli that generate incongruous sensory and perceptual responses in biological
processing. To analyze the perceptual discrepancies within artificial neural networks, a selection of
models are provided examples of illusion and non-illusion pairs. When pre-trained for simple but
distinct vision tasks, both networks physically encode illusory percepts in their intermediate represen-
tations, in so demonstrating non-objective processing akin to biological perception. Modifications to
these networks, however, undo the illusion encoding, suggesting that certain key mechanisms drive
the perception-like processing.
